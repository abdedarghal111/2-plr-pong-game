# About this repository

This is a small project I did to test my java knowledges.

It's a pong game for 2 players.

## Controls

Press `W` and `s` to move blue stick.

Press `up arrow`and `down arrow` to move red stick.

## Mechanics

The ball speed increases with every hit until someone loses.

## Observations

The `autoguardar en git.bat` file is a bad practice. Don't use it.
